### Pandas open source ecosystem

growth python -> data science and pandas at core of this growth


ECOSYSTEM

- pandas:
  - what is the focus of pandas (tabular data, in memory, ...)
  - general development focus:
    - new features / enhancements: IO functionality, IntervalIndex, ... (overview of highlights pandas 0.18-0.22)
    - clean-up API: deprecations of Panel, .ix, 
  - current improvement areas: extensions
- ibis: lazy, epxression, familiar interface to other execution engines)
- dask: scale
- apache arrow: interoperability (common memory format)
  - practical current use cases: parquet, IPC (eg dask, ray)
  - future: shared C++ data science library that can be used by different
    languages/libraries (including pandas)

OPEN SOURCE PROJECT

- come back to growth python for data science
- growth in usage of pandas
    - how many users? -> rough estimate, trends in website visitors, pypi downloads, ...
  => project management need to scale as well
- how is it doing currently?
  - evolution of
    - number of issues, PRs, activity on github
    - number of contributors

- how to support this open source community?

- complain, ... (slides PyParis)

=> **engage** in the community


estimate of Travis Oliphant (5-10 million users)

## Pandas: data analysis in python

Targeted at working with **tabular or structured data** (like R dataframe, SQL table, Excel spreadsheet, ...):

- Import and export your data
- Clean up messy data
- Explore data, gain insight into data
- Process and prepare your data for analysis
- Analyse your data (together with scikit-learn, statsmodels, ...)

Powerful for working with missing data, working with time series data, for reading and writing your data, for reshaping, grouping, merging your data, ...

Its documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/

---

# Key features

* Fast, easy and flexible input/output for a lot of different data formats
* Working with missing data (`.dropna()`, `.isna()`, `.fillna()`)
* Merging and joining (`concat`, `join`)
* Grouping: `groupby` functionality
* Reshaping (`(un)stack`, `pivot`)
* Powerful time series manipulation (resampling, timezones, ..)
* Easy plotting


---

Focus of pandas

- tabular (2D, heterogenous)
- in memory


???

- other packages extend this
- and known: memory can be "big data" on a big machine


---

# Current development focus


### Bug fixes, new features and enhancements

--



* IO functionality (Parquet format support, styled excel output, JSON table schema, S3 support, ...)
* DataFrame.aggregate
* IntervalIndex
* ...
* Coming: extending pandas data types and methods

---

# Current development focus


### Bug fixes, new features and enhancements

### Clean-up of the API

--

* Deprecation of `Panel`
* Deprecation of `.ix`
* Sum of empty Series
* Indexing with missing labels
* ...

### Dask is a flexible library for parallelism

* **Parallelizes libraries** like Pandas, NumPy, and SKLearn
* Lets you work on **larger-than-memory** datasets
* **Scales** from 1 to 1000's of computers
* Written in pure Python
* That leverages the excellent Python ecosystem
* Using blocked algorithms and task scheduling

# Apache Arrow

Cross-language development platform for in-memory, columnar data

Source: https://arrow.apache.org/

  - practical current use cases: parquet, IPC (eg dask, ray)
  - future: shared C++ data science library that can be used by different
    languages/libraries (including pandas)

---

# Apache Arrow

Practical use cases *now*:

* Projects can share functionality (eg, Parquet-to-Arrow reader, ODBC connection)
* Pandas: `to_parquet` / `read_parquet` for the Parquet file format (https://parquet.apache.org/)
* Interprocess communication (e.g. Dask, Ray) and cross-system communication (e.g. PySpark)

--
count: false

And in the *future*:

* Shared Arrow-native computational libraries 
* Foundations for evolution of pandas

# Pandas 2.0

### Planning significant refactoring of the internals

### Goals: make pandas ...

* Faster and use less memory
* Fix long-standing limitations / inconsistencies
* Easier interoperability / extensibility


# Pandas 2.0

* Fixing long-standing limitations or inconsistencies (e.g. in missing data).
* Improved performance and utilization of multicore systems.
* Better user control / visibility of memory usage.
* Clearer semantics around non-NumPy data types, and permitting new pandas-only data types to be added.
* Exposing a “libpandas” C/C++ API to other Python library developers.

More information about this can be found in the “pandas 2.0” design documents: https://pandas-dev.github.io/pandas2/index.html

to be clear: hackatons and sprints are great to introduce people to contributing to open source,

A lot of work is needed (code, design, ..). We need YOUR help.

### ... will impact users.

We need YOUR input on that.

Those deprecations are part of path to 1.0
with view of 2.0
    what is the vision for that?
Many changes coming, we need YOUR input on that
Pandas: growth over time (get statistics from page website?), downloads
    but limited resources, limited core contributors (6 to 10)

Efficient indexing of non-sorted or overlapping intervals:

[1, 5)     b

Output of `pd.cut`, gridded data, genomics, ...
